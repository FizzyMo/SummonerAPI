    <!-- About me and this site -->
    The website retrieves data from the League of Legends API and displays it dynamically on the webpage using
    JavaScript. The website can obtain summoner information, ranked statistics, and champion mastery details by
    accessing the API's endpoints and giving the necessary parameters (summoner name, area, etc.). The received data is
    subsequently structured and presented to the user in a visually pleasing and organized manner.

    Hello and thank you for visiting my League of Legends webpage! My name is Carisa Saenz-Videtto, and I have over four
    years of experience as a web designer and developer. I've always been interested in video games, and League of
    Legends is one of my favorites.

    For many years, Legends has been one of my favorite games. My adventure in web design and development began when I
    realized I could mix my love of gaming with my coding and design talents. I set out to build a website that would
    appeal particularly to League of Legends gamers, offering them a hub of relevant information, resources, and an
    engaging community.
